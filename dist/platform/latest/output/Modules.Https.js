However, the intermediate CA cannot be trusted\nuntil its identity is verified. The certificate of the intermediate CA must be checked to see if the\nCA is trusted.

Use this reference to call the \n<code>createX509CertificatePinningSecurityManager()</code> method to authenticate the specified HTTPS URLs.\nPass in an array of dictionaries as the only required parameter to the method. Each\ndictionary in the array contains two keys:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>url</code>: URL of the server to contact</li>\n<li><code>serverCertificate</code>: X.509 certificate in DER format to verify the server's identity</li>\n<li><code>trustChainIndex</code>: Index of the trust-chain certificate to validate against (default: 0 - leaf certificate). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var securityManager = https.createX509CertificatePinningSecurityManager([\n    {\n        url: 'https://www.yourorg.com',\n        serverCertificate: 'yourorg.der'\n    }\n]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the security manager is created, create an <code>HTTPClient</code> object and set the\n{@link Titanium.Network.HTTPClient#property-securityManager securityManager} property to the security manager\nobject you just created.  You must set this property when creating the <code>HTTPClient</code> instance.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var httpClient = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({\n    onload: function(e) {\n        Ti.API.info('Received text: ' + this.responseText);\n    },\n    onerror: function(e) {\n        Ti.API.error(e.error);\n    },\n    timeout : 5000,\n    // You can only set this property when creating the HTTPClient\n    securityManager: securityManager\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the <code>securityManager</code> property is set, call the <code>HTTPClient</code>'s <code>open()</code> and <code>send()</code>\nmethods to initiate the HTTPS request.</p>\n\n<pre><code>httpClient.open('GET', 'https://yourorg.com');\nhttpClient.send();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the authentication fails, a security exception is thrown. The HTTP client's <code>onerror</code>\ncallback will be passed an error object with the <code>code</code> key set to <code>-1</code> and the <code>message</code> key\nset to the following message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Certificate could not be verified with provided public key\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To perform another HTTPS request, you need to create another <code>HTTPClient</code> object and follow the\nsame procedure to initiate an HTTPS request.

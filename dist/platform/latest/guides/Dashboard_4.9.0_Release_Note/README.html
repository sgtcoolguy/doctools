        <h2 class="heading "><span>Behavior Changes</span></h2>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Updated the password policy. Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters in length, cannot use repeating character sequences (e.g. 11111), and must not be a common weak password (e.g. &quot;password&quot; or &quot;12345678&quot;).    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Added stronger protection against invalid account access attempts. User accounts are temporarily locked and login attempts will be rejected if five or more failed login attempts occur.  The user will receive an email indicating there was suspicious activity on the account and provide a link to unlock the account.  Additionally, failing multiple login attempts across more than one account may result in further login attempts being rejected temporarily.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Session expiry is now based on elapsed period of user inactivity. The default session expiry for a web session is 30 minutes.  If the user checks the &quot;Keep me signed-in for one week&quot; option during login, the expiry is increased to 7 days.    </p>

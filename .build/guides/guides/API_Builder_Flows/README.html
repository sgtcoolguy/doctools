    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-51254148_APIBuilderFlows-Introduction">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p>Beginning with API Builder V3.0.0 (Included in CLI 7.0.0), you can manage endpoints and their associated flows using the API Builder Console. You can also create and edit flows and configure their associated flow-nodes using the API Orchestration user interface.    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-51254148_APIBuilderFlows-Manageendpoints">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Manage endpoints</span></h2>
    <p>An API endpoint provides a way for a client to access your application, such as <tt class=" ">GET &lt;SERVER_ADDRESS&gt;/api/users/query</tt> and access the application&apos;s models and/or custom code blocks to return data back to the client application. You can use the API Builder Console to import, generate, export, and delete endpoints. For additional information, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Manage_Endpoints">Manage Endpoints</a>.    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-51254148_APIBuilderFlows-Floworchestration">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Flow orchestration</span></h2>
    <p>Flows can be viewed and edited on the    <span style="color: #000000;">
 API Orchestration user interface. Additionally,     <span style="color: #000000;">
you can manage flow-node configuration and connections on the API Orchestration user interface. For additional information on the     <span style="color: #000000;">
API Orchestration user interface    </span>
 and for flow-node configuration reference information, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Flow_Orchestration">Flow Orchestration</a>.    </span>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Manage flows</span></h2>
    <p>    <span style="color: #000000;">
Flows are acyclic directed graphs of operational flow-nodes which are composed of inputs, logic, and outputs. They are used by endpoints, which require them for their runtime functionality of taking inputs and turning them into responses when an endpoint is hit.     <span style="color: #000000;">
    <span style="color: #000000;">
You can <strong class=" ">use</strong> the API Builder Console and the associated API Orchestration user interface to view, create and edit flows.    </span>
    </span>
 For additional information, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Manage_Flows">Manage Flows</a>.    </span>

    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-51254148_APIBuilderFlows-Managenodes">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Manage nodes</span></h2>
    <p>Flow-nodes represent an individual portion of functionality in a flow. You can use the     <span style="color: #000000;">
API Orchestration user interface     </span>
to add, configure, and delete flow-nodes. You can also connect and disconnect flow-nodes in a flow. For additional information, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Manage_Nodes">Manage Nodes</a>.    </p>

    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-51254148_APIBuilderFlows-AxwayFlowSDK">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Axway Flow SDK</span></h2>
    <p>The Axway Flow SDK (<tt class=" ">axway-flow-sdk</tt>) is a standalone utility that enables the creation of custom flow-nodes for API Builder flows. For additional information, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Axway_Flow_SDK">Axway Flow SDK</a>.    </p>

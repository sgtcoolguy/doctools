</li></ul>    <p>This topic describes how to manage the API endpoint flow-nodes and the connections between flow-nodes on the API Orchestration user interface. The API Orchestration user interface is divided into the following panels:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class="ux-has-slash-separator ">    <p>Flow-node list (left side of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides a graphical listing of the Model and Core flow-nodes. The default Core flow-node types are Custom, Codeblock, Compose, Condition, Delay, HTTP, JSON, and Set Context. A model flow-node is displayed for each configured model and an endpoint flow-node is displayed for each imported endpoint.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Flow editor (center of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides a graphical space to view, edit, and create flows.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Flow-node configuration (right side of the API Orchestration user interface) - Provides the functionality to configure the Name, Method, Parameters, and Outputs of flow-nodes.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>API Orchestration user interface example:    </p>

For additional information on the Model and General flow-node output configuration for each method, refer to <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Flow_Orchestration">Flow Orchestration</a>. Once the flow-node is properly configured, the warning message is longer displayed and the flow-node is longer highlighted.    </p>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Titanium best practices</span></h2>
    <p>Though both Titanium and JavaScript are highly flexible, we have found that certain approaches lead to better outcomes. As a guide, we look for techniques that achieve these goals:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Stable &#x2013; applications must be stable when published and available to the market.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Rapid &#x2013; applications must be rapid to develop, maintain, and update.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Performant &#x2013; applications must perform optimally, approaching 1:1 native speed on targeted devices.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Readable &#x2013; applications must have a readable codebase for quick understanding, modification, and improvement.    </p>
</li></ol>    <div class="section section-3 " id="src-30082360_safe-id-QmVzdFByYWN0aWNlc2FuZFJlY29tbWVuZGF0aW9ucy1Eb2VzYmVzdC1wcmFjdGljZXJlYWxseW1lYW5vbmx5LXByYWN0aWNlPw">
        <h3 class="heading "><span>Does best-practice really mean only-practice?</span></h3>
    <p>In the general sense, no. However, the contents of this guide are distilled from the experience and practices of Appcelerator&apos;s Professional Services engineers with input from the Engineering department, Developer Relations team, Training department, and of course our many supportive customers.    </p>

    <p>In this section, we&apos;ll lay our cards on the table and describe what we&apos;ve come to believe is the best way to build a Titanium applications. (There&apos;s good stuff in the other chapters. So at least circle back to them when you&apos;re done here.)    </p>
    <p><strong class=" "><a class="document-link " href="CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium.html">CommonJS Modules in Titanium</a></strong>    </p>
    <p>This is a big enough topic that we&apos;ll give it its very own section. Learn how to write and use CommonJS modules here.    </p>
    <p><strong class=" "><a class="document-link " href="Application_Frameworks.html">Application Frameworks</a></strong>    </p>
    <p>In this topic, we&apos;ll share techniques for implementing large-scale Titanium apps as well as techniques for separating presentation and content (and business logic).    </p>
    <p><strong class=" "><a class="document-link " href="Image_Best_Practices.html">Image Best Practices</a></strong>    </p>
    <p>In this section, we&apos;ll share some wisdom about how to handle images, including caching remote images, loading and unloading to minimize memory usage, and optimizing images with tools like pngcrush.    </p>
    <p><strong class=" "><a class="document-link " href="Working_with_a_SQLite_Database.html#src-29004901_WorkingwithaSQLiteDatabase-Bestpractices">Database Best Practices</a></strong>    </p>

                        <h1>Welcome To Titanium!</h1>
    <p>Titanium&apos;s unique trait among the various available cross-platform mobile solutions is that it creates truly native apps. This is in contrast to web-based solutions that deliver functionality via an enhanced web view. Titanium, not wanting to be limited by the native web view, has engaged in a much deeper integration with the underlying platforms. This gives Titanium developers the ability to leverage native UI components &amp; services, as well as near-native performance, features you won&apos;t find in other cross-platform mobile development solution. In addition, you&apos;ll have access to other features like:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Platform specific APIs    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Location-based services    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Social sharing    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Rich multimedia    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Online and on-device data    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Extensibility    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>and much more!    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>Titanium empowers you to create immersive, full-featured applications that go beyond the boundaries of the browser. We do the heavy-lifting on cross platform compatibility so you don&#x2019;t have to. Featuring over 80%code  reuse across mobile apps, Titanium provides a deep, yet highly-reusable development platform. Appcelerator licenses Titanium under the Apache 2 license and is free for both personal and commercial use.    </p>
    <p>In this chapter, you&apos;ll and learn the basics of writing cross-platform mobile apps with Titanium and become familiar with resources available to you. In addition, we&apos;ll take a brief look at the JavaScript skills you&apos;ll need to be an effective Titanium developer.    </p>

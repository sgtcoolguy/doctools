    <p>As an administrator, the AMPLIFY Platform lets you view details about your organization, manage the users who have access to the AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services, and manage the applications created by members of your organization. All of these functions are available through the <strong class=" ">Organization</strong> page. To access this page, sign in to the <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://platform.axway.com">AMPLIFY Platform</a> and select the current organization from the <strong class=" ">User</strong> menu.    </p>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Concepts</span></h2>
    <p>Users belong to organizations. An organization is a group of people working for the same entity &#x2013; typically the members of a company or some subset of a company.    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Organization <i class=" ">members</i> can create new Titanium applications in Appcelerator Studio or register an Android or iOS application in Dashboard. These applications belong to the organization the user designated during the app creation process.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Organization <i class=" ">admins</i> can create applications, invite users to join the organization, and assign organization members to <i class=" ">application teams</i>.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>A user can have different administrator rights:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><i class=" ">Org Admin<strong class=" "> </strong></i>gives the user access to manage the organization.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><i class=" ">API Runtime Services Admin</i> gives the user access to manage API Runtime Services application associated with the organization using the <tt class=" ">acs</tt> CLI, including republishing or remove applications.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>A user can be a member of multiple organizations. In this case, the user will see an organization switcher in the Profile drop-down, located in top-right of the Appcelerator Dashboard.    </p>
    <p>An application team is a group of people working on a single application. Application team members can have different roles:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><i class=" ">Application admins</i> can add users to the application team, change user roles, and update or modify the application&apos;s data. The user who creates an application becomes an admin for that application by default. Some ACS APIs can only be called by application admins.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><i class=" ">Application members</i> can access application data.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>All the data generated by an application is visible to members and admins of the app and the admins of the organization the app belongs to. Organization admins can see data for all of the organization&apos;s applications.    </p>
    <p>An organization can have children organizations. These children organizations are allocated user and device account resources from the parent organization. An administrator of the parent organization can create children organizations and manage applications and users for both the parent and children organizations.    </p>

        <h3 class="heading "><span>Roles and features</span></h3>
    <p>Users can be assigned different roles that grant them the rights to the Dashboard associated with their assigned role. Those roles and rights are:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Org Admin</strong> - User who has administrator rights over your organization&apos;s Dashboard.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Developer</strong> - User who has general developer rights.    </p>

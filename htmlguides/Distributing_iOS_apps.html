        <h2 class="heading "><span>Introduction</span></h2>
    <p>In this section, you will learn how to distribute your iOS application.  Apple provides three ways to distribute your application based on which developer program you are a member of:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">App Store or iTunes Store</strong>: Publish your application to the iTunes Store.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">In House</strong>: Publish your application in house for your company&apos;s employees.  Members of the Apple Developer Enterprise program see this option instead of the App Store option.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Ad Hoc</strong>: Publish your application as a package that can be distributed on a limited number of devices for testing.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>Both work flows are similar except ad hoc distribution requires you to specify a list of devices when creating your provisioning profile and you need to specify two extra options (file format and location) when packaging your application with Studio.    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-27595277_DistributingiOSapps-Contents">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Contents</span></h2>
    <p>Publishing your iOS application involves a few, somewhat involved steps. Fortunately, you have done two of these steps already if you have deployed your app to a device for testing. The steps are:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Register with the iOS Developer Center    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Create an App ID in the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Create and install the distribution certificate    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Create and install a distribution provisioning profile    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Build your app, embedding the distribution provisioning profile    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Upload the app to iTunes Connect and kick-off the Apple review process <strong class=" ">OR </strong>distribute your application package.    </p>
</li></ol>    <p>    <img src="images/download/attachments/27595277/ios_publishing_process.png" alt="images/download/attachments/27595277/ios_publishing_process.png" class="confluence-embedded-image" width="300">

    <div class="section section-3 " id="src-27595277_DistributingiOSapps-RegisteringandcreatingtheAppID">
        <h3 class="heading "><span>Registering and creating the App ID</span></h3>
    <p>By now, you should have registered for the <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://developer.apple.com">iOS developer program</a>. And you should have tested your app on a device, which means you&apos;ve created an App ID on the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page. If you plan to sell your app, rather than distribute it for free, you need to register on the iTunes Connect site and supply legal and banking information to Apple. They must verify your legal status and banking info. That process can take as much as a week or more.    </p>
    <p>An App ID is a unique identifier for your app. It is composed of two parts: the App ID Prefix and the App ID Suffix. The App ID Prefix is a 10-character hexadecimal string generated by the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page. It is unique to you and your developer account. The App ID Suffix is a name you enter called the Bundle Identifier.    </p>
    <p>The Bundle Identifier can be explicit, meaning you enter a name on the iOS Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles page and enter that exact same identifier as the App ID of your application. You can also create a wildcard Bundle Identifier. Wildcard Bundle IDs are great for quick development &#x2013; you do not have to create a new ID for each and every app you test. However, you cannot use some iOS features with a wildcard ID. You must create an explicit Bundle ID if you plan to use push notifications, iAd, or Game Center features.    </p>
    <p>See <a class="document-link " href="Deploying_to_iOS_devices.html#src-27595262_DeployingtoiOSdevices-CreateanAppID">Deploying to iOS devies: Create an App ID</a> for step-by-step instructions on creating an App ID.    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-3 " id="src-27595277_DistributingiOSapps-Createandinstallthedistributioncertificate">
        <h3 class="heading "><span>Create and install the distribution certificate</span></h3>
    <p>The distribution certificate attests to the identity of the entity publishing the app. According to Apple: &quot;Only Team Agents are authorized to prepare and submit applications for distribution.&quot; The Team Agent is the person at your organization who oversees development and final distribution of your app. While each developer on your team could have their own developer certificate, you or your company will have a single distribution certificate. This arrangement enables you to add or remove people from your development team, while not giving those folks the means to publish your final app. That will be controlled by you.    </p>
    <p>The Team Agent will be the user account associated with creation and first-logon to your provisioning portal account.    </p>
    <p>To create a distribution certificate:    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Log in to the <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/">Apple Developer Member Center</a> as the Team Agent or Admin.    </p>

</li><li class=" ">    <p>Select <strong class=" ">App Store and Ad Hoc</strong>, then click <strong class=" ">Continue</strong><strong class=" ">.</strong>    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Follow the directions to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Click <strong class=" ">Continue</strong><strong class=" ">.</strong>    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Upload your CSR and click <strong class=" ">Generate</strong>.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>You will be returned to the Certificates page with the status listed as Pending. Wait a moment then refresh the page in your browser.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Even though you are logged in as the Team Agent or Admin, you will need to approve your certificate. Click <strong class=" ">Approve</strong>.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Download the distribution certificate (.cer) file to your computer.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Double-click the file to install it into your keychain.    </p>

    <p class="p1">    <span style="color: #3e3e3e;">
It is critical that you save your private key somewhere safe in the event that you need to develop on multiple computers or decide to reinstall your system OS. Without your private key, you will be unable to sign binaries and test your application on any Apple device.     <span style="color: #3e3e3e;">
The private key was generated by the Keychain application when you created the Certificate Signing Request (CSR). It has the same name as the     </span>

        <h3 class="heading "><span>Create and install the distribution provisioning profile</span></h3>
    <p>As with deploying an app for testing, you need to create a provisioning profile file. The distribution provisioning profile gathers together your distribution certificate and App ID. If this is an Ad Hoc provision profile, you also need to specify your devices.    </p>
<ol class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Log in to the <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/">Apple Developer Member Center</a> as the Team Agent or Admin.    </p>

.    </span>
    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Enter a name for your provisioning profile. You should use a word like &quot;distribution&quot; or &quot;ad hoc&quot; in the name so that it is clear later that this profile is for final distribution or ad hoc distribution, respectively.  Click <strong class=" ">Generate</strong>.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Click <strong class=" ">Download </strong>to save your provisioning profile file (.mobileprovision) to your computer, then click <strong class=" ">Done</strong>.    </p>
</li></ol>    <p>You have two options to install the provisioning profile file onto your development computer. You can drag the file and drop it on the Xcode icon, or you can install it from Studio by following the steps in the following section. Either way, installing the provisioning profile is a one-time operation (on each computer, until it expires).    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-3 " id="src-27595277_safe-id-RGlzdHJpYnV0aW5naU9TYXBwcy1CdWlsZHlvdXJhcHAsZW1iZWRkaW5ndGhlcHJvZmlsZXdpdGhpbnRoZWFwcCdzYnVuZGxl">

            <p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), make sure you grant Studio access to the computer as described in <a class="document-link " href="Installing_the_iOS_SDK.html#src-29004875_safe-id-SW5zdGFsbGluZ3RoZWlPU1NESy1Ob3RlZm9yTWF2ZXJpY2tzKGFuZGxhdGVyKQ">Installing the iOS SDK: Running on Mavericks</a>.    </p>

        </p>
    <p>Once you are done with the preceding steps, use Studio to build your app for final distribution. To package your application for distribution, first select the project in the <strong class=" ">Project Explorer</strong> view, then in the global tool bar, select  <strong class=" ">Package</strong> from the <strong class=" ">Launch Mode</strong> drop-down list. From the <strong class=" ">Target </strong>drop-down list, choose <strong class=" ">iOS iTunes Store</strong>  to distribute to the App Store or  <strong class=" ">iOS</strong> <strong class=" ">Ad Hoc/Enterprise</strong> to distribute to a limited number of devices (ad hoc) or for in-house distribution. If the <strong class=" ">Launch Automatically</strong> option is enabled under the<strong class=" "> Target</strong> drop-down list, the application will be automatically launched after the target is selected.  If not, you need to click the <strong class=" ">Launch</strong> button to start the build process.    </p>
    <p>If you have not previously distributed your app using Studio, you will see the following wizard dialog box. The wizard walks you through the necessary steps to build and distribute your app.    </p>
    <p>On the <strong class=" ">General</strong> page, ensure the requirements have been satisfied and select the desired SDK version. <u class=" "><strong class=" ">For ad hoc and in-house distribution,</strong> </u> specify the package format as <strong class=" ">ipa</strong> and a path to copy the package to. Click <strong class=" ">Next</strong>.    </p>

        </p>
    <p>On the <strong class=" ">Certificates</strong> page, select your distribution certificate and keychain. Click <strong class=" ">Next</strong> to proceed.    </p>
    <p>    <img src="images/download/attachments/27595277/DiA_Certificates.png" alt="images/download/attachments/27595277/DiA_Certificates.png" class="confluence-embedded-image" width="300" height="340">
    <br>Provisioning profiles are specified on the last page. To install the provisioning profile, click the <strong class=" ">Browse...</strong> button, locate your .mobileprovision file, and click <strong class=" ">Open</strong> to install that profile into Xcode. If you have installed more than one provisioning profile, make sure to choose the one that corresponds to your app and your distribution certificate. Select a Provisioning Profile and click <strong class=" ">Finish</strong>.    </p>

        </p>
    <p>Studio packages your iOS application. For App Store distributions, the final signed IPA file is installed into the <strong class=" ">Archives</strong> tab of the Xcode Organizer and should be automatically lauched after building the package.  For Ad Hoc distributions, the file is copied to the specified path.    </p>
    <p>If you get errors, most likely source of trouble is that the app ID you entered in the tiapp.xml file doesn&apos;t match your distribution certificate and your provisioning file. Check each carefully to be sure that you&apos;re selecting the right requirements.    </p>
    <p>The next time you execute the Distribute action, you will see a more simplified wizard where you specify the certificate, provisioning profile, and iOS SDK. You can navigate to the iOS Platform preference page to view and modify current iOS platform settings using the <strong class=" ">Manage settings</strong> link    </p>

        <h3 class="heading "><span>Creating the App ID on iTunes Connect</span></h3>
    <p>The iTunes Connect site is your app distribution management portal for App Store builds. You can get to iTunes Connect from the Apple Developer Member Center site. If you have not done so yet, make sure to set up your iTunes Connect profile and supply the legal and banking information required by Apple. They verify all the documents you supply, a process that can take more than a week in some cases. You will not be able to publish your app until that process is complete.    </p>
    <p>From the iTunes Connect site, click <strong class=" ">Manage Your Apps</strong> then click <strong class=" ">Add New App</strong>. You need to supply:    </p>

    <p>If you built your app with Studio, it should be stored in the <strong class=" ">Archives</strong> tab of the Xcode Organizer. Open that window now and select your app. Click <strong class=" ">Verify</strong>. You will be prompted for your iTunes Connect user name and password. At this point, Xcode will check for an app definition on iTunes Connect and make sure it matches the app you have created. Both sides of that app need matching names, bundle IDs, and so forth.    </p>
    <p>Assuming you have passed the verification step, click the <strong class=" ">Submit</strong> button. Again, you will be prompted for your iTunes Connect credentials (unless you specified to save them). Xcode makes sure your iTunes Connect app is in the Waiting for Upload state and if so, it will upload your app. This switches your app to the Waiting for Review state. This is the point where your app is submitted to Apple for their review and final approval.    </p>

        <h3 class="heading "><span>App Store requirements</span></h3>
    <p>Apple publishes many guidelines that describe what they look for when deciding to approve an app. We encourage you to <a class="external-link external-link" href="http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html">read their guidelines</a> carefully. A few of the requirements include:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p>Apps must be useful, well-designed, and run without errors    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Apps cannot download and execute code    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>You must own all copyrights and trademarks used within the app and its promotional resources    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p>Apps cannot contain hidden features or use non-public APIs    </p>

        <h2 class="heading "><span>Alloy Framework</span></h2>
    <p><strong class=" "><a class="document-link " href="Alloy_Framework.html">Alloy</a></strong> is a framework developed by Appcelerator based on the model-view-controller architecture and provides built-in support for various third-party, freely-distributable JavaScript libraries, such as Backbone.js and Underscore.js. Alloy abstracts the Titanium API, making it easier and quicker to write maintainable applications.    </p>

    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-30085344_ApplicationFrameworks-Angularsupport">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Angular support</span></h2>
    <p>We are currently in the process of integrating Titanium SDK with Angular. This is under active development and is not yet released. More details may be found at this blog post announcing the effort: <a class="external-link external-link" href="https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2018/02/introducing-angular-support-in-titanium/">https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2018/02/introducing-angular-support-in-titanium/</a>    </p>

    <div class="section section-2 " id="src-30085344_ApplicationFrameworks-Previoussuggestedframeworks">
        <h2 class="heading "><span>Previous suggested frameworks</span></h2>
    <p>We provide here two reference application frameworks that have been used successfully by Appcelerator prior to the creation of Alloy. Neither is a model that as a company we &quot;bless&quot; as <i class=" ">the</i> approach to use. Both are examples of ways you <i class=" ">could</i> structure an app, and each offers benefits or stylistic choices that might fit within your programming experiences and comfort levels.    </p>
    <div class="section section-3 " id="src-30085344_ApplicationFrameworks-MVCstyleappframework">
        <h3 class="heading "><span>MVC style app framework</span></h3>
    <p>This sample framework adapts a model-view-controller architecture, defines an event architecture, and defines an object inheritance pattern. It is not a pure MVC implementation. It also was created prior to our adoption of CommonJS require() as the preferred technique. Still, it is an instructive model and has been used successfully for Appcelerator-led projects. see <a class="document-link " href="MVC_Style_App_Framework.html">MVC Style App Framework</a> for more details.    </p>

        <h3 class="heading "><span>Modern JavaScript app framework</span></h3>
    <p>The Developer Relations team&apos;s Community app represents a type of &quot;true&quot; JavaScript app that doesn&apos;t attempt to apply another language&apos;s constructs. It uses CommonJS modules and carefully protects the global scope. It takes advantage of Titanium&apos;s platform build directories for run-time optimization. And it demonstrates how to wrap native proxies rather than extending them (which is a no-no!).    </p>
    <p>This app is not a template for new projects. It is a living app, one that is in constant development by our Development Relations team. We encourage you to pull ideas from the app rather than specific code. Learn more about it here: <a class="document-link " href="Community_app.html">Community app</a>    </p>

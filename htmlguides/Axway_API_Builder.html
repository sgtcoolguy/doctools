    <p>API Builder lets you build and deploy API endpoints that can be consumed by any client application. API Builder applications are made up of several components:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder APIs</strong> can be defined in two ways:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Programmatically</strong>: Defined in Javascript via the API Builder API. These are custom endpoints that allow you to access and execute custom operations on data.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Configuration</strong>: Defined as Swagger 2.0 document. These are files which describe and document RESTful APIs which are composed of one or more endpoints.    </p>
</li></ul></li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Blocks</strong> are filters that allow you to pre- or post-process data    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Codeblocks</strong> are nodes which can be used within Flows to implement advanced business logic not possible through the configuration of supplied nodes alone    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Connectors</strong> are adaptors to allow you read and write data to and from an external data source, such as <a class="document-link " href="Mobile_Backend_Services.html">Mobile Backend Services</a>, MySQL, Salesforce, and MongoDB, or in server memory    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Endpoints</strong> are endpoints as described by a configuration-based API    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Flows </strong>are graphs of pre-defined nodes which are used to implement the business logic of an endpoint    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">API Builder Models</strong> are structured data with predefined API endpoints to access them<strong class=" "> </strong>    </p>

    <p>API Runtime Services hosts applications, built with API Builder, and Appcelerator pre-built services,    <span style="color: #333333;">
 which includes the Mobile Backend Services.    </span>

<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Mobile Backend Services</strong> (formerly known as ArrowDB) provides pre-built REST objects, such as Users or Photos. Mobile Backend Services can be integrated with your Titanium, Node.js, Android or iOS application.    </p>

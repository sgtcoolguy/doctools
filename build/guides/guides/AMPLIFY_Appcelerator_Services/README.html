    <p>Appcelerator Services are a set of features that include:    </p>
<ul class=" "><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Appcelerator Test</strong>: Integrated automated functional testing for your application allowing developers and testers to collaborate on recording tests directly on the mobile device, executing tests and analyzing the results.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Appcelerator Performance</strong>: Monitor your application&apos;s health, crashes and overall performance to help developers diagnose why applications crash and focus on specific issues based on user feedback.    </p>
</li><li class=" ">    <p><strong class=" ">Appcelerator Analytics</strong>: Track your applications&apos; user adoption and engagement to help understand how your application is used, which features are not used and decide what will go in the next version of your application.    </p>
</li></ul>    <p>For Titanium applications, activate the services using Appcelerator Studio, which enables basic analytics and performance data collection.  For advanced features, you need to add Titanium API calls to the application.    </p>
    <p>For native Android applications built with Java and iOS applications built with Objective-C, use the <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/Managing_Non-Titanium_Client_Applications_in_Dashboard">Dashboard to activate Appcelerator Services</a> and the <a class="document-link " href="#!/guide/AMPLIFY_Appcelerator_Services_Native_SDKs">AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services Native SDKs</a> to integrate the services with the application.    </p>
